ELS supports the use of Java regular expressions in JSON library file
definitions for ignore_patterns and the "from" element of renaming.

Plain text changes without regular expressions are simple.

To remove "DVD":
```
        "renaming": [
            {
                "from": "DVD",
                "to": ""
            }
        ]
```

To make that case-insensitive:
```
        "renaming": [
            {
                "from": "(?i)DVD",
                "to": ""
            }
        ]
```

(?<!X)	X, via zero-width negative lookbehind
(?>X)	X, as an independent, non-capturing group

Backslashes, escapes, and quoting:

The backslash character ('\') serves to introduce escaped constructs, as defined in the 
table above, as well as to quote characters that otherwise would be interpreted as 
unescaped constructs. Thus the expression \\ matches a single backslash and \{ matches 
a left brace.

It is an error to use a backslash prior to any alphabetic character that does not denote 
an escaped construct; these are reserved for future extensions to the regular-expression 
language. A backslash may be used prior to a non-alphabetic character regardless of whether 
that character is part of an unescaped construct.

Backslashes within string literals in Java source code are interpreted as required by 
The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification as either Unicode escapes (section 3.3) or other 
character escapes (section 3.10.6) It is therefore necessary to double backslashes in 
string literals that represent regular expressions to protect them from interpretation 
by the Java bytecode compiler. The string literal "\b", for example, matches a single 
backspace character when interpreted as a regular expression, while "\\b" matches a 
word boundary. The string literal "\(hello\)" is illegal and leads to a compile-time 
error; in order to match the string (hello) the string literal "\\(hello\\)" must be used.

Character Classes:

Character classes may appear within other character classes, and may be composed by 
the union operator (implicit) and the intersection operator (&&). The union operator 
denotes a class that contains every character that is in at least one of its operand 
classes. The intersection operator denotes a class that contains every character that 
is in both of its operand classes.

The precedence of character-class operators is as follows, from highest to lowest:

1    	Literal escape    	\x
2    	Grouping	[...]
3    	Range	a-z
4    	Union	[a-e][i-u]
5    	Intersection	[a-z&&[aeiou]]

Note that a different set of metacharacters are in effect inside a character class than 
outside a character class. For instance, the regular expression . loses its special 
meaning inside a character class, while the expression - becomes a range forming 
metacharacter.
