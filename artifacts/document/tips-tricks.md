ELS has many nuances built-in to its features. Here are some Tips 'n Tricks.
Suggestions for additions to this list are welcome.

 * Tools
    * Tools may be defined that are intended to be run by hand, or as part of an automated Job, or both.

   * Renamer Tools<br/>
     Important point: When using the Renamer Tool the "Old Name" & "New Name" list are _only examples_
     and are __not__ the files that will be used with the Run button. The Run button uses whatever is
     selected in the Browser. The list does not have to be refreshed before using the Run button.

     * Feature nuance: Running a Renamer tool manually uses the sorting of the selected
       files in the Navigator Browser. The default behavior is processing the files in
       alphabetical order, i.e. in a command line-executed Job.
       * Example: 
         * To order a set of files with season and episode numbering:
           * In the Browser use Touch on each episode in the order desired.
           * Sort the file list by ascending date.
           * Select the desired files.
           * Run your Renamer numbering tool or a Job on that list of files.
