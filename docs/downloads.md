## &bull; Updates

ELS Navigator uses a matching auto-updater that it downloads from the GitHub project.

Use Help, Check for Updates ... to see if a new build is available. If so a dialog
is displayed with Yes, No, and Changelist that will display the list of the latest changes
from GitHub.

Help, Changelist shows the list of changes in the installed version.
