# Directory /docs

This directory contains the content of the ELS GitHub Pages website: https://corionis.github.io/ELS/

The _config.yml YAML file is auto-modified from a template during Ant builds to include the version
name and build stamp of the latest.

The ```serve``` script uses a previously-install Jekyll site generator for viewing during development
prior to committing changes. See https://jekyllrb.com/
