Entertainment Library Synchronizer (ELS) Version 4 is a purpose-built library and title oriented tool for managing and backing-up data
with expandable storage spanning multiple devices.

Any project with large amounts of data for home videos, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, game development, 3D modeling, science, or media systems such as Plex
and Jellyfin, organizing and managing your work is important. And backing it up is critical.

  wide variety of capabilities.
