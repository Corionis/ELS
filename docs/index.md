Any project with large amounts of data for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, game development, science, or media systems such as Plex 
organizing and managing your work is important. And backing it up is critical. 

ELS is a tool with both graphical and command line interfaces and a wide variety of powerful capabilities.

 * ELS was started in 2015 as a command line back-up tool for home media systems. Version 4.0 adds a full-featured desktop application.

 * Views a collection of libraries spanning multiple storage devices the same way modern media systems do - on a logical library basis - 
   such as movies, TV shows, video segments, graphics, sound effects, etc.
   
   Works well for home media systems, video and music projects, graphics modeling, game projects, scientific data or any large amount 
   of information needing to be organized and backed-up.

 * Has several modes of operation including the Navigator desktop application, new in version 4, and several command-line automation modes to provide a 
  wide variety of capabilities.

 * Includes several built-in Tools that may be combined into Jobs to automate a sequence of Tasks.

 * Works locally or remotely over a LAN or the Internet with two computers running ELS. All communication is encrypted.
