# Privacy & Security

## Privacy

We are not lawyers so this is a general statement: 

Entertainment Library Synchronizer and the ELS website do not track individuals. 

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses
Google Analytics to see how people are using the site and what versions are being downloaded 
by count and filename. Again, no personally-identifying information is collected. 
See the

The ELS application does not collect or send any data to anyone. It is a tool under your control.

## Security

Entertainment Library Synchronizer is capable of working locally on one computer, or remotely
over a LAN or the Internet. All remote communication from the initial "handshake" to file transfers
is encrypted. ELS will only communicate with another ELS with the correct set of credentials.
