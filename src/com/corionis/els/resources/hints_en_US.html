<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>
    Hints are optional and used to track manual changes made to a Library. Those changes
    are propagated to other back-ups either when they are connected using the Run button or
    at back-up time. Hint Tracker/Server is not used by Subscriber Listeners or Terminals.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The changes that tracked are rename, move and delete. Additions or copies are a normal part
    of ELS back-up operations and do not involve Hints.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    When enabled Hints are automatically created when any tracked action is performed on
    a Library. Hints are not tracked on System tab content.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    When tracked actions are performed ELS checks for conflicts with existing Hints and will
    cancel the action and display a message dialog. If multiple ELS instances (Navigators) are
    participating they must all have "live" connections to a Hint Tracker/Server for Hints and
    conflicts to be tracked and detected.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    When opening a Publisher the Collection/Workstation radio button controls whether Hints
    are tracked for actions on that Library. Collections are tracked, Workstations are not.
    This supports ELS Navigator running on a computer used to create content with a Collection
    as the Subscriber. The Collection may have one or more back-ups all using Hints.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
    For Hints to be enabled the following is required:
    <ul>
    <li>A Hint Keys file of Libraries (back-ups) participating in Hints.</li>
    <li>A Hint Tracker/Server Library to manage Hint data.</li>
    <li>For a remote Hint Server an Authentication Keys file of ELS instances that are
        allowed to connect is also required.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Hint Keys</h4>
<p>
    After one or more Libraries have been created use System, Hint Keys to create
    name/key pairs. The name may only use alphanumeric characters with no special
    characters or whitespace. The key is one of the existing Library keys. Use the
    Key List button to select one from a list.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Hint Track/Server Library keys should <b>not</b> be in Hint Keys.
</p>

<h4>Hint Tracker/Server</h4>
<p>
    A Hint Tracker is a Library created to hold the Hints data.
    <ul>
        <li>A single Location.</li>
        <li>A single Library in it's Bibliography.</li>
        <li>A single Source for the Library.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    A Hint Tracker is ELS configured to use Hints where the data is stored
    locally on the system running ELS. It's build-in.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    A Hint Server is ELS running as a separate process (on another computer) using
    a Hint Tracker library, similar to a Subscriber Listener. When used remotely
    a valid network name or IP address and port are required, e.g. 10.1.1.5:50271
</p>

<h3>Executing Hints</h3>
<p>
    Hints are designed so they may be propagated to back-ups <i>later</i> during
    back-up operations. However Hints may also be executed on any connected library that
    is participating in Hints using the Run button.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Once all back-ups participating in Hints have executed a Hint the Hint is removed.
</p>

<br/>
<i><b>Note:</b></i>
<p>
    These options must be defined on the command line, or in an Operation that can
    also be used as a Task in a Job.<br/>
    <p>
    <br/>
    Hint Keys:
        <blockquote>-k | --keys [file] or -K | --keys-only [file]</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        Hint Tracker/Server:
        <blockquote>-h | --hints [files} or -H | --hint-server [file]</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        Both options are required.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        For a remote Hint Server the Authentication Keys option is also required. <blockquote>-A | --auth-keys [file]</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
        The -K | --keys-only option executes Hints and other back-up options, such as --duplicates,
        but does not perform a back-up operation.
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    For new remote configurations it is easiest to copy the library and system files to each
    ELS instance using something like Filezilla.
</p>
