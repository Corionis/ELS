<h2 id="version-400">Version 4.0</h2>
<p>This major release 4.0 of ELS adds the ELS Navigator desktop application and a
    variety of related enhancements and changes. </p>
<p>The Navigator is purpose-built to make building and on-going maintenance of collections
    of all types of data across multiple storage devices easier. Originally built for home
    media collections ELS 4.0 adds a new dimension to library-based, multi-device, cross-platform
    file management.</p>

    <p>Using the built-in capabilities of ELS the Navigator provides a
    visual tool for curating a collection either locally or remotely.
    Tools and jobs are provided to make performing repetitive tasks easier. And the original
    back-up tool is built-in of course.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Modes (where the Navigator is running)<ul>
        <li>On a media collection where Hints are tracked</li>

        <li>Create and edit ELS Authentication keys, Hint keys, blacklist and whitelist</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Like the rest of ELS the new Navigator is a general tool for anyone manipulating
    large volumes of data across multiple storage devices and is also compatible with modern media
    systems such a Plex Media Server and Jellyfin. Works on Windows, Linux and Mac.</p>

<p><em>It&#39;s all built-in</em>.</p>

<h3 id="upgrade-notes">Upgrade Notes</h3>
<p>ELS 4.0 is significantly different from previous versions. Changes and bug fixes have been
    made throughout the code, too numerous to list every change. Read these notes thoroughly when
    upgrading for changes, additions and enhancements.</p>
<ol>
    <li>When upgrading to ELS 4.0 from previous versions be sure to complete all Hint
        processing <em><strong>prior to the upgrade</strong></em>. Ensure the Hint Tracking datastore is empty. The
        syntax used in the .els Hint files has been updated.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>With the Navigator a formal directory structure is needed to store the various
        configuration files. The location may be defined using the -C | --config option.
        The default is the user's home directory in subdirectory .els/</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>ELS Navigator.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigator is a publisher in ELS terms, by design.</li>
            <li>Navigator supports two scenarios:<ol>
                <li>On a media collection such as a media server system, and optionally
                    connected to a back-up running an ELS subscriber listener.</li>
                <li>On a separate workstation, and optionally connected to a media
                    collection system or back-up running an ELS subscriber listener.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The File, Open Publisher dialog shows radio buttons for Collection or Workstation.<ol>
                <li>This setting determines whether Hints are stored when Hint Tracking is enabled.<ol>
                    <li>If Collection then the Hints are added, and tracked if enabled.</li>
                    <li>If Workstation then Hints are not used during operations.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Command-line behavior changes when using -n | --navigator:<ol>
                <li>-P sets the Navigator for running on a Collection</li>
                <li>-p sets the Navigator as a Workstation</li>
                <li>-S sets the Navigator for a remote Subscriber</li>
                <li>-s sets the Navigator as a local Subscriber</li>
                <li>Note: The distinction of collection or library is not used with
                    the Navigator. All data displayed are from active storage scans.</li>
            </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><p>New ELS project download options including an all-in-one with an embedded Java JRE.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The remote communication paradigm has been changed to provide more reliability.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="command-line-changes">Command Line Changes</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>The -n | --rename option has been removed in favor of the rename tool in the
        Navigator.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The -n option has been repurposed for the Navigator and the --navigator option has been added.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -y | --preserve-dates to retain original file dates.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -z | --decimal-scale to format numeric (B, KB, MB, GB, TB) values with
        a 1000 decimal scale instead of a 1024 binary scale.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -j | --job to execute a previously-defined ELS Job. If the name contains
        whitespace enclose it in quotations. In this mode the job controls ELS actions.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -A | --auth-keys for subscriber and publisher listeners. This is the same
        format as Hint Keys. Authentication keys are used to authenticate both workstations and
        publishers instead of requiring a specific system defined by -s|S.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -g | --listener-keep-going. For a Publisher the &quot;keep going&quot; option skips
        sending the quit command to the subscriber when the backup operation is complete. For a
        subscriber it skips ending with a fault on an unexpected disconnect (EOL) and ignores
        quit commands. To stop a subscriber in this mode use the --listener-quit command.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -G | --listener-quit that only sends the stop command to a remote
        subscriber, then exits. Similar to the -Q | --force-quit option.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -B | --blacklist that uses a text file of one-line IP addresses to filter
        and block incoming connections. The blacklist supports # style comments and blank lines.
        Each IP address is an IPv4 dotted address, e.g. 127.0.0.1, on separate lines.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -I | --ip-whitelist to filter and allow incoming connections. Similar to
        the -B | --blacklist file.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Changed the behavior of -u | --duplicates where duplicates are now only logged when
        this option is enabled.  Otherwise only a total number is reported in the statistics.
        Previously duplicates were always reported in a back-up or dry-run. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -E | --empty-directories where empty directories are logged when this
        option is enabled. Otherwise only a total number is reported in the statistics.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added option -N | --ignored to log ignored files. For backup runs and the --duplicates option.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Implemented detailed logging of communications-related steps using the &quot;trace&quot; log level
        for the --console-level and --debug-level options.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added remote mode J to the -r|--remote option. This is to support command-line use of
        the &quot;Any Subscriber&quot; origin option of Job tasks. Combined with -j|--job the remote
        subscriber defined with -s|-S is used. This is in contrast to the &quot;Specific Subscriber&quot;
        origin option where the subscriber defined for the task overrides the -s|-S option.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added --dump-system that prints all JVM System.getProperties() values then exits.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added -C | --config to set the location of the ELS configuration directory. Use
        &quot;-C .&quot; for the current directory. Default is user home directory in .els/</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added --marker &quot;arg&quot; to aid in identifying a running process. Any &quot;arg&quot; is ignored.
        This option has no effect on ELS and is intended to help with scripting.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added -O | --override-subscriber-server [address:port]. If address:port is defined that is used,
        otherwise the Listen port is used for out-going connections to a Subscriber instead of the server.
        Subscriber listeners use the Listen address unless the [address:port] is defined. If Listen is
        not defined the Host is used. Outgoing connections use the Host address unless the -O option
        for Listen or the [address:port] are defined.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added -J | --override-hint-server to use the listen address:port for out-going connections
        to a Hint Server instead of the server. Used for outgoing LAN connections where server is used
        over the Internet. Hint Server uses the Listen address. There is no optional [address:port]
        because there can be only one.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added the --logger option for the -j | --job action to execute the Job in the foreground
        with ELS operating in Logger mode to display the Job log. It is used internally when
        executing a Job in the foreground.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added -V option to check for updates from the command line (terminal) and a checkForUpdate
        script in the installation bin/ subdirectory.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added -Y option to install updates from the command line and an installUpdate script
        in the installation bin/ subdirectory. Always installs update even if versions match.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-changes">Other Changes</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>The ELS Navigator has necessitated the introduction of a formal user-based directory
        structure to hold the various preference, bookmark, library, tool, job, etc. files.
        All these items are kept in each user&#39;s HOME/.els/ directory.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: When upgrading from ELS versions earlier than 4.0 copy your existing library JSON
            files to your HOME/.els/libraries/ directory. If that directory does not exist create it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>When using the ELS interactive terminal (not to be confused with ELS Navigator) the
        &quot;bye&quot; command has been changed to end the terminal session but leave the remote listener
        running. Commands quit, exit and logout will shutdown the remote listener.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added JSON library elements for temporary files:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>temp_dated &quot;true/false&quot; : If temporary files such as received collection files have
                date and time embedded in the filename. If false the same file is overwritten.</li>
            <li>temp_location &quot;path&quot; : Where to place temporary files. An empty string &quot;&quot; is the
                location of the ELS Jar file. If the path begins with &quot;<del>/&quot; the user&#39;s home directory
                    is substituted for the &quot;</del>&quot;.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><p>Removed JSON library element &quot;renaming&quot; and the related Java code.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Changed the JSON library &quot;ignore_patterns&quot; behavior:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the pattern contains the path separator literal for that repository the full path is matched.<ol>
                <li>For example pattern: &quot;.<em>\/Plex Versions.</em>&quot; will exclude the directory &quot;/Plex Versions&quot; and any
                    subdirectories and files.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If the pattern does not contain the path separator literal only the right-end directory or file name is matched.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added a new authentication technique for subscriber and publisher listeners.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Normally the publisher and subscriber are specific.<ol>
                <li>If a connection is made to a listener and it is not the specific system expected
                    the listener will fail and exit.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>However if the listener is running with the -A|--auth-keys Authentication Keys file option
                authentication matches against all the keys. So a single subscriber listener can connect to
                one or more remote ELS publishers or ELS Navigators concurrently.<ol>
                    <li>The current limit is 100 concurrent connections. </li>
                    <li>This is the same technique used by the Hint Status Server using a Hint keys file.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The reasons for separate listener authentication keys and hint keys:<ol>
                <li>A listener may want to allow Navigator sessions in addition to back-up systems.</li>
                <li>Hint keys control:<ol>
                    <li>Which back-up systems are setup to process hints.</li>
                    <li>Which systems are tracked and status maintained in the Hint datastore.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><p>Modified the code for methodical exit code status values. Exit code 0 is normal, 1 indicates a
        fault occurred. Exit code 130 is returned if Ctrl-C is hit on the command line. Useful for error
        handling in multi-step automation batch files or scripts.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Changed free space checking when backing-up a group of files so the value checked is reduced as
        each item in the group is copied. GitHub Issue #55.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Added JSON &quot;timeout&quot; element for the stty protocol in minutes. This provides a mechanism to avoid
        process hangs and the implementation uses an internal heartbeat to keep the connection alive during
        long-running operations. The heartbeat is <em>not</em> an actual ping.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Changed Hint syntax handling to use the more formal syntax generated by the Navigator.
        <strong>Important:</strong> When upgrading to ELS 4.0 from previous versions be sure to complete all Hint
        processing and make sure for any Hint Tracking being used, local or remote, the datastore is
        empty.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="operational-notes">Operational Notes</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>When running Navigator with a remote Subscriber and executing a backup Job that would normally stop
        the listener when done be sure to start the remote subscriber listener with the
        -g | --listener-keep-going option to avoid a connection fault in Navigator when the backup is complete.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>When performing long copy/move operations multiple copy/paste and drag &#39;n drop operations
        may be <i>batched</i>. Each operation is added to the existing batch(es) of running operations and
        are processed in order.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>When running a backup operation or copying/moving content in Navigator the target path
        is determined dynamically when the target is a library. Because of this the available
        free space is checked during the copy/move operation and cannot be checked before the
        copy/move begins.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="developer-notes">Developer Notes</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>The ELS Navigator was built using <a href="https://www.formdev.com/jformdesigner/doc/">JFormDesigner</a>.<br/>
        This inexpensive plug-in for IntelliJ allowed the creation of the Navigator
        much faster and with far fewer mistakes.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>For existing user-written scripts add the &quot;-C .&quot; option to set the working directory to the current
        directory. See Command Line Changes.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the addition of the Hint Status Server where a remote ELS session is
    employing 3 ELS processes - hint server, subscriber, and publisher - it was
    necessary to rearrange the disconnect/shutdown logic and sequences. These
    changes implement a more formal, and less brute-force, disconnect and quit
    approach allowing for future n-way connection possibilities.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>For IntelliJ to run and debug the multiple processes the Multirun plugin
    has been added with a variety of configurations in the .idea project.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The mock directory has been completely rearranged to support testing and
    provide a completely self-contained development and test environment.
    In addition a mock/scripts/linux/ directory has been added with many scripts
    to perform application-level tests using pre-set publisher and subscriber
    collections and hint files.</p>
    <p>These scripts show many of the various ways ELS may be executed using
    different combinations of options. See the **README** in that directory for
    more information and a description of the testing sequence.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>For IntelliJ users several run/debug configurations have been added that
    match the scripts in the mock/scripts/linux/ directory organized in the
    same way and use the same mock/ data.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
