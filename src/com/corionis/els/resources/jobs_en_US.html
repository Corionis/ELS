<h2>Jobs</h2>
<p>Jobs combine Tools into sequences of Tasks to define the connections required for each step.
This allows a Tool to be reused with different Jobs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jobs execute defined Tasks in the sequence specified. A Task is a defined Tool with
starting Origin(s) as arguments to the Tool.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>The Add button for Tasks displays a list of Tools that have been previously created.
The list of Tools is updated each time the button is clicked.</p>

<h3>Task Origins</h3>
<p>Select the Library and connection type accordingly by clicking the "..." button.
The options provided depend on the type of Task being defined.</p>

<ul>
  <li>"From: [name]" is only shown if a previous task's Origins are available.</li>
  <li>"Any publisher" will use any loaded publisher</li>
  <li>"Specific publisher" allows selection of a publisher from the list of libraries</li>
  <li>"Any subscriber" will use any loaded subscriber</li>
  <li>"Local subscriber" allows selection of a local subscriber from the list of libraries</li>
  <li>"Remote subscriber (Host, Internet)" allows selection of a remote subscriber connecting on the Host address</li>
  <li>"Remote subscriber (Listen, LAN)" allows selection of a remote subscriber connecting on the Listen address</li>
  <li>"Remote subscriber (Custom)" allows entry of a remote subscriber connecting with a Custom server or IP address:port</li>
  <li>"Local Hint Tracker" enables Hint processing using the current ELS instance.</li>
  <li>"Remote Hint Server (Host, Internet)" enables Hint processing connecting on the Host address.</li>
  <li>"Remote Hint Server (Listen, LAN)" enables Hint processing connecting on the Listen Address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remote Subscriber Listeners only listen on the Listen or Custom address. If the Listener value is not
 defined for that Library the Host value is used. Any Custom address must be valid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The type of connection must be defined. Hint Servers only listen on the Listen address. If that value is not
defined for that Library the Host value is used. Because there can be only one Hint Tracker/Server
there is no Custom option as provided for remote Subscribers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For <b>Any publisher</b> and <b>Any subscriber</b> Task Origins the current Publisher and/or Subscriber
are used when the Job is executed.
<ul>
  <li>If executed in the current instance using the Run ... button the currently-loaded publisher
    and/or subscriber are used by the Job.</li>
  <li>If executed in a separate ELS instance from the command line, a shortcut, or using the Generate/Run ... button
    the publisher and subscriber arguments <u>must be added if necessary.</u></li>
</ul>

<p>The Origins Add button uses <i>whatever is currently selected in the Browser</i>. That means
combinations can be assembled that do not necessarily make sense or will execute correctly. For instance
selecting subscriber libraries in the Browser, but choosing a different subscriber for the Job that does not
have matching libraries.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some tasks, such as the Renamer, can use the Origins of a previous task. When previous Origins
are available a "From: [name]" selection is added as the first entry in the <b>...</b> combobox. That entry
is the most recent task capable of providing Origins prior to the current task. A series of these
tasks may be defined to perform complex operations.</p>

<h3>Run ...</h3>
<p>The Run button will execute the currently-selected Job in the currently-running ELS instance.</p>

<h3>Generate/Run ...</h3>
<p>Creates a command line to execute the currently-selected job.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edit as desired. Select the Copy button to copy the command line to the clipboard.
Select the Shortcut ... button to create a desktop shortcut, or the Run ... button to
execute the Job in a new instance of ELS either in the foreground or background.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Note:</b><br/>
<p>Depending on your choices additional parameters may be required for the
Job to run correctly. In particular, if <b>Any publisher</b> or <b>Any subscriber</b> has
been selected for any Tasks in the job then -p and/or -s parameters <i>will be</i> needed.</p>
