<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>ELS uses a publisher/subscriber paradigm to present a collection of logical libraries from a
local publisher to a subscriber, or back-up. The subscriber may be local, with all storage devices
attached, or remote using another ELS instance operating as a Subscriber Listener.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each logical library may span multiple storage devices. This is the same approach used by
modern media streaming systems, such as Plex, but is also useful for anyone producing large
volumes of content, videos, music, images, ata, etc. Each storage Location may specify a "Minimum
Free Space". A library is defined as a Bibliography of storage Locations used by the library.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ELS may be run in a variety of modes. The visible mode is this ELS Navigator. However, several
other command line modes are available to automate ELS operations. ELS started as a command line
back-up tool. The addition of the Navigator desktop application in Version 4 added significant
functionality.</p>

<h3>Start-up Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Define a publisher on the Libraries tab.</li>
    <li>Use File, Open Publisher to open the new publisher.</li>
    <li>Define one or more subscribers (back-ups) on the Libraries tab.</li>
    <li>Use File, Open Subscriber to open the new subscriber.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Browser</h3>
<p>The Browser presents a publisher and subscriber in a drag 'n drop interface. Selections made in
the Browser are used by the Tools and Jobs. Selections may be changed while working with Tools and Jobs,
e.g. using the Duplicate Finder select the Publisher and click "Run ...", then select the Subscriber and
click "Run ..." again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Publisher and Subscriber tabs present the logical library structure. The System tabs present that
computer's entire directory tree.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>Various Tools are provided to make building and maintaining libraries easier. The Duplicate Finder
and Empty Directory Finder are used manually. The other Tools may be run by themselves or combined
into Jobs.</p>

<h3>Jobs</h3>
<p>Jobs are combinations of one or more Tools. Jobs are composed of Tasks which are a Tool with selections
for the publisher and subscriber.</p>

<h3>System</h3>
<p>The System menu contains advanced features for security and Hint processing.</p>
