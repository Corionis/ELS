<h2>Whitelist</h2>
<p>The Whitelist is a simple list of IPv4 IP addresses that are allowed to connect
    to this instance when it is operating as a publisher or subscriber listener.</p>

<p>The Whitelist is generally more useful than the Blacklist because it avoids
    hacking attempts if a hacker finds the port used by ELS.</p>

<p>The Whitelist, if defined, is evaluated first, then the Blacklist if defined. The
    check is performed when a incoming connection is made but before the authentication
    handshake is attempted between the systems. If the check fails the socket is
    summarily closed and the occurrence is logged.</p>

<p>NOTE: These options must be defined on the command line or in an Operation for them
    to be used. The Navigator dialogs only edit the files.</p>
