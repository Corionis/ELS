<h2>Jobs</h2>
Jobs execute defined Tasks in the sequence defined. A Task is a defined Tool with
starting Origin(s) as arguments to the Tool.

<h3>Tasks</h3>
The Add button for Tasks displays a list of Tools that have been created previously.
The list of Tools is updated each time the button is clicked.

<h3>Task Origins</h3>
Select the publisher and/or subscriber accordingly by clicking the ... button.
<ul>
  <li>"Any publisher" will use any loaded publisher</li>
  <li>"Specific publisher" allows selection of a publisher from the list of libraries</li>
  <li>"Any subscriber" will use any loaded subscriber</li>
  <li>"Specific subscriber" allows section of a subscriber from the list of libraries</li>
</ul>
The Add button uses <i><b>whatever</b> is currently selected in the Browser</i>. That means
combinations can be assembled that do not necessarily make sense or will execute correctly.

<h3>Generate</h3>
The Generate button creates a <i>basic</i> command line to execute the currently-selected
job. Edit and copy (Ctrl-C) as desired.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your choices additional parameters may be required for the
command line job to run correctly. In particular, if "<b>Any publisher</b>" or "<b>Any subscriber</b>" has
been selected for the job then -p and/or -s parameters <i>will</i> needed.
