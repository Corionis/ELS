<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>The Operations tab defines parameters and options for executing ELS in one of the
various modes.</p>
<br/>
Named configurations may be executed:
<ul>
  <li>Using the Run button</li>
  <li>Added as a Task in a Job</li>
  <li>With a command line copy or shortcut using the Generate button</li>
</ul>

Respectively, the publisher and subscriber for execution come from:
<ul>
  <li>The currently loaded libraries in the ELS Navigator Browser</li>
  <li>As parameters in the command line -p|-P and -s|-S</li>
  <li>From the defined Task Origins in a Job</li>
</ul>

<p>Targets : Specifying a targets file - that describes libraries, their sources,
and the minimum free space for the library - is optional. It was the original
way to define where new content would go and will continue to be supported.
If targets are not specified ELS looks for "locations" defined in the library
file. Locations describe minimum free space per storage location.</p>

<p>If those are not found the list of sources for the library in the library file
is used with a default minimum free space of 10GB. In all cases the order of
the definitions controls the order for searching where to place new content
for that library.</p>

<h3>Generate</h3>
The Generate button creates a command line for executing the currently-selected
operation. Edit and copy (Ctrl-C) as desired.<br/>
