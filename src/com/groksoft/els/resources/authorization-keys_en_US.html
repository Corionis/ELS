<h2>Authorization Keys</h2>
<p>Authorization Keys control what ELS instances are allowed to access this ELS instance. Those may
    include publishers and Navigators. Note a subscriber is the same as a publisher.
    Their role as a publisher or subscriber is controlled by which is defined for
    the -p|-P and -s|-S options.</p>

<p>An Authorization Key is the "key" element from a collection JSON file.<br/><br/></p>

<h3>UUID List Button</h3>
<p>The UUID List button present a list of known collection files and displays the
"description" and "key" elements from each file found in the ELS ./libraries/ directory.</p>

<p>NOTE: These options must be defined on the command line or in an Operation for them
    to be used. The Navigator dialogs only edit the files.</p>
