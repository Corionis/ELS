<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>Libraries define parameters and options for ELS library JSON files.</p>
<br/>
<b>Requires flushing out all the details.</b>

<h3>Key Points</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Different types of repositories, e.g. Publisher, Subscriber and Hint Server, use different combinations of parameters.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>A Hint Server only uses one Location, one Library with one Source for it's datastore.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>General tab, Host is the hostname:port or IP address:port used by outside ELS systems to connect to this ELS instance.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>General tab, Listen is the hostname:port or IP address:port listener operations use to listen for incoming connections. If not defined
    Host is used. This setting is used with NAT or port forwarding to route incoming traffic to an inside system.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>General tab, Terminal allowed provides interactive access to an ELS instance when running in a listener mode. It is primarily used for
    diagnostic purposes to test the STTY command channcel. The -a|--authorize [password] option is required to enable interactive access
    for the listener.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>Locations tab defines devices or partial paths used to check for available free storage space. Fully-qualified partial paths to their
    length should match the beginning of the full paths used in Library sources. Relative partial paths to their length should be contained
    within the full paths used in Library sources. If a target for a backup, copy or move operation does not have a matching Location the
    default minimum free space is 1 GB. A Target -t|-T file is still supported but is being phased-out in favor of Locations. There is no
    Navigator dialog for editing targets JSON files however they may still be defined on the command-line. Defined Targets minimum free
    space overrides Locations.<br/><br/></li>
  <li>Bibliography tab, Sources is the list of one or more storage devices or paths that comprise a library. The order of the sources
    defines the order searched for available free space, depending on the run-time setting of "Back-fill".</li>
